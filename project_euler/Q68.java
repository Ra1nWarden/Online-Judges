		 * To get the maximum number,
		 * the numbers on the node should be as small as possible.
		 * Test from 13.
		 * 13 is not possible since the total sum for all five sides will then be 65.
		 * Subtract this by 55 (1+2+3+...+10)
		 * The remainder is 10 which could not be expressed as the sum of the lowest 5 numbers. (15)
		 * Hence, Starting from 14.
		 * The numbers inside the ring are 1~5.
		 * By simple calculation, a result will be obtained.
